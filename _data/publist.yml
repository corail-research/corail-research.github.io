- title: "Combinatorial optimization and reasoning with graph neural networks"
  image: GNN-pic.png
  description:  "Combinatorial optimization is a well-established area in operations research and computer science. 
  Until recently, its methods have focused on solving problem instances in isolation,
   ignoring the fact that they often stem from related data distributions in practice. 
   However, recent years have seen a surge of interest in using machine learning, 
   especially graph neural networks, as a key building block for combinatorial tasks. 
   This paper presents a conceptual review of recent key advancements in this emerging field, 
  aiming at researchers in both optimization and machine learning"

- title: "Combining reinforcement learning and constraint programming for combinatorial optimization"
  image: AAAI2021-pic.png
  description:  "We propose a general and hybrid approach, based on deep reinforcement learning and constraint programming,
   for solving combinatorial optimization problems. 
   The core of the approach is based on a dynamic programming formulation, 
   that acts as a bridge between both techniques."

  image: ewarehouse-2021.png
  description:  "E-commerce with major online retailers is changing the way people consume. 
  The goal of increasing delivery speed while remaining cost-effective poses significant 
  new challenges for supply chains as they race to satisfy the growing and fast-changing demand. 
  In this paper, we consider a warehouse with a Robotic Mobile Fulfillment System, 
  in which a fleet of robots stores and retrieves shelves of items and brings them to human pickers."

- title: "Learning TSP Requires Rethinking Generalization"
  image: CP2021-pic.png
  description:  "End-to-end training of neural network solvers for 
  combinatorial problems such as the Travelling Salesman Problem 
  is intractable and inefficient beyond a few hundreds of nodes. 
  While state-of-the-art Machine Learning approaches perform closely to classical solvers for trivially small sizes,
   they are unable to generalize the learnt policy to larger instances.
   This paper proposes controlled experiments in the first principled investigation into such zero-shot generalization,
    revealing that extrapolating beyond training data requires rethinking the entire neural combinatorial optimization
    pipeline. "

- title: "Improving Optimization Bounds using Machine Learning: Decision Diagrams meet Deep Reinforcement Learning"
  image: AAAI2019-pic.png
  description: "Finding tight bounds on the optimal solution is a critical element of 
  practical solution methods for discrete optimization problems. 
  In the last decade, decision diagrams have brought a new perspective on obtaining upper and lower bounds that 
  can be significantly better than classical bounding mechanisms.
  We propose a generic approach based on deep reinforcement learning 
  for obtaining an ordering for tightening the bounds obtained 
  with relaxed and restricted decision diagrams."
