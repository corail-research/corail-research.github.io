- title: "Peel-and-Bound: Generating Stronger Relaxed Bounds with Multivalued Decision Diagrams"
  image: CP2022-Peel.png
  description:  "Decision diagrams are an increasingly important tool in 
  cutting-edge solvers for discrete optimization.
   However, the field of decision diagrams is relatively new, 
   and is still incorporating the library of techniques that conventional
    solvers have had decades to build.
     We drew inspiration from the warm-start 
     technique used in conventional solvers to address one of the major challenges
      faced by decision diagram based methods."

- title: "Scheduling the Equipment Maintenance of an Electric Power Transmission Network Using Constraint Programming"
  image: CP2022-HQ.png
  description:  "Modern electrical power utilities must maintain their electrical equipment 
  and replace it when the end of its useful life arrives.
  The Transmission Maintenance Scheduling (TMS) problem consists in 
   generating an annual maintenance plan for electric power transportation equipment 
   while maintaining the stability of the network and ensuring a continuous power flow 
   for customers. Each year, a list of equipment (power lines, capacitors, transistors, etc.)
    that needs to be maintained or replaced is available and the goal
     is to generate an optimal maintenance plan.
      This paper proposes a constraint-based scheduling approach for
       solving the TMS problem."

  description:  "This paper studies the use of reinforcement learning to compute a 
  variable ordering of decision diagram-based approximations
   for discrete optimization problems.
    This is among the first works to propose the use of
     machine learning to improve upon generic bounding methods 
     for discrete optimization problems, 
     thereby establishing a critical bridge between optimization and learning."

- title: "Learning the travelling salesperson problem requires rethinking generalization"
  image: CP2021-pic.png
  description:  "End-to-end training of neural network solvers for 
  combinatorial problems such as the Travelling Salesman Problem 
  is intractable and inefficient beyond a few hundreds of nodes. 
  While state-of-the-art Machine Learning approaches perform closely to classical solvers for trivially small sizes,
   they are unable to generalize the learnt policy to larger instances.
   This paper proposes controlled experiments in the first principled investigation into such zero-shot generalization,
    revealing that extrapolating beyond training data requires rethinking the entire neural combinatorial optimization
    pipeline. "

  description:  "Combinatorial optimization is a well-established area 
  in operations research and computer science.
   Until recently, its methods have focused on solving problem instances in isolation, 
   ignoring that they often stem from related data distributions in practice.
    However, recent years have seen a surge of interest in using machine learning 
    as a new approach for solving combinatorial problems, 
    either directly as solvers or by enhancing exact solvers. 
    Based on this context, the ML4CO aims at improving state-of-the-art 
    combinatorial optimization solvers by replacing key heuristic components."
