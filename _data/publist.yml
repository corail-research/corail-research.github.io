- title: "Learning Valid Dual Bounds in Constraint Programming: Boosted Lagrangian Decomposition with Self-Supervised Learning"
  image: AAAI2025.png
  description: "Lagrangian decomposition (LD) is a relaxation method that provides a dual bound for constrained optimization problems
   by decomposing them into more manageable sub-problems. 
   This bound can be used in branch-and-bound algorithms to prune the search space effectively. 
   In brief, a vector of Lagrangian multipliers is associated with each sub-problem, and an iterative procedure 
   (e.g., a sub-gradient optimization) adjusts these multipliers to find the tightest bound. 
   Initially applied to integer programming, Lagrangian decomposition also had success in constraint programming 
   due to its versatility and the fact that global constraints provide natural sub-problems. 
   However, the non-linear and combinatorial nature of sub-problems in constraint programming makes it computationally
   intensive to optimize the Lagrangian multipliers with sub-gradient methods at each node of the tree search.
    To address this challenge, we propose a self-supervised learning approach that leverages neural networks to
    generate multipliers directly, yielding tight bounds."

- title: "A machine-learning-based column generation heuristic for electric bus scheduling"
  image: CAOR2025.jpg
  description:  "Bus scheduling in public transit consists in determining a set of bus schedules to cover a set of timetabled trips at minimum cost.
   This planning process has evolved recently with the advent of electric buses that introduce constraints related to vehicle autonomy and 
   battery charging process. In particular, column-generation algorithms have regained popularity for solving problems similar to the one 
   considered in this paper, namely, the multi-depot electric vehicle scheduling problem (MDEVSP)
    with a piecewise linear charging function and capacitated charging stations. To tackle large-scale MDEVSP instances,
    we design a machine-learning-based column generation heuristic that relies on reduced-sized networks to generate the bus schedules."

- title: "Learning and Fine-tuning a Generic Value-Selection Heuristic Inside a Constraint Programming Solver"
  image: CP2023-tom.png
  description:  "Constraint programming is known for being an efficient approach for solving combinatorial problems. 
  Important design choices in a solver are the branching heuristics, which are designed to lead the search to the best solutions in a minimum amount of time.
  Although several generic variable-selection heuristics are available in the literature, 
  the options for a generic value-selection heuristic are more scarce.
  This paper introduces a generic learning procedure that can be used to obtain a value-selection heuristic 
  inside a constraint programming solver. This has been achieved thanks to the combination of a deep Q-learning algorithm, a tailored reward signal, 
  and a heterogeneous graph neural network architecture."

  image: NeurIPS2025.png
  description: "The ability of large language models (LLMs) to mimic human-like 
  intelligence has led to a surge in LLM-based autonomous agents. 
  Though recent LLMs seem capable of planning and reasoning given user instructions, their effectiveness
   in applying these capabilities for autonomous task solving remains underexplored.
  This is especially true in enterprise settings, where automated agents hold the promise of a high impact.
   To fill this gap, we propose WorkArena++, a novel benchmark consisting of 682 tasks corresponding to realistic workflows routinely
    performed by knowledge workers. WorkArena++ is designed to evaluate the planning, problem-solving, logical/arithmetic reasoning, 
    retrieval, and contextual understanding abilities of web agents."

  description:  "Lagrangian relaxation is a versatile mathematical technique employed to relax constraints in an optimization problem, 
  enabling the generation of dual bounds to prove the optimality of feasible solutions and the design of efficient propagators in constraint programming (such as the weighted circuit constraint).
However, the conventional process of deriving Lagrangian multipliers (e.g., using subgradient methods) is often computationally intensive, limiting its practicality for large-scale or time-sensitive problems.
To address this challenge, we propose an innovative unsupervised learning approach that harnesses the capabilities of graph neural networks to exploit the problem structure, aiming to generate accurate Lagrangian multipliers efficiently."

- title: "Estimating Road Construction Costs with Explainable Machine Learning"
  image: IJAA2024.png
  description:  "A preliminary estimation of construction costs is a crucial operation of any project related to civil engineering. An accurate estimation ensures a proper management of the available funds and helps the project managers in their decision-making processes. 
  In order to select a subcontractor, the project manager needs to have an accurate idea of a reasonable price for the subtask given. A price higher
  than expected is undesirable, but a price significantly lower than expected may also result in poor quality of service. This paper introduces a framework for estimating construction costs while tackling both challenges. It is based on six machine learning models
  and on Shapley additive explanations. This project was commissioned by the Ministry of
  Transport and Sustainable Mobility, a public agency responsible for transport infrastructure in Quebec, Canada."

   Each year, a list of equipment (power lines, capacitors, transistors, etc.)

- title: "Towards a Generic Representation of Combinatorial Problems for Learning-Based Approaches"
  image: CPAIOR2024-Leo.png
  description:  "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using learning-based approaches for solving combinatorial problems, 
  either in an end-to-end manner or in conjunction with traditional optimization algorithms. 
  In both scenarios, the challenge lies in encoding the targeted combinatorial problems into a structure compatible with the learning algorithm.
  this paper advocates for progress toward a fully generic representation of combinatorial problems for learning-based approaches.
   The approach we propose involves constructing a graph by breaking down any constraint of a combinatorial problem into 
   an abstract syntax tree and expressing relationships (e.g., a variable involved in a constraint) through the edges."

- title: "SeaPearl: A Constraint Programming Solver guided by Reinforcement Learning"
  image: seapearl.jpg
  description:  "This paper presents the proof of concept for SeaPearl, 
  a new constraint programming solver implemented in Julia, 
  that supports machine learning routines in order to learn branching decisions using reinforcement learning. 
  Support for modeling the learning component is also provided."

- title: "Combining reinforcement learning and constraint programming for combinatorial optimization"
  image: AAAI2021-pic.png
  description:  "We propose a general and hybrid approach, based on deep reinforcement learning and constraint programming,
   for solving combinatorial optimization problems. 
   The core of the approach is based on a dynamic programming formulation, 
   that acts as a bridge between both techniques."

- title: "Improving Optimization Bounds using Machine Learning: Decision Diagrams meet Deep Reinforcement Learning"
  image: AAAI2019-pic.png
  description: "Finding tight bounds on the optimal solution is a critical element of 
  practical solution methods for discrete optimization problems. 
  In the last decade, decision diagrams have brought a new perspective on obtaining upper and lower bounds that 
  can be significantly better than classical bounding mechanisms.
  We propose a generic approach based on deep reinforcement learning 
  for obtaining an ordering for tightening the bounds obtained 
  with relaxed and restricted decision diagrams."
