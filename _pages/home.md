**CORAIL** is a research group focusing on the design of efficient and accessible methods for **solving challenging combinatorial problems**. Specifically, we develop innovative hybrid algorithms that combine techniques from **artificial intelligence**, such as **logical reasoning**, **machine learning**, and **operations research**. To do so, we are using various methods such as constraint programming, backtraking algorithms, reinforcement learning, and deep learning.

The group mission is to show how different sub-fields of artitifical intelligence can be combined together in order so solve challenging decision-making problems, arising in many industrial contexts. One of our focus is on the accessibility of the methods conceived. We strive to make them easy to use for non-experts and small companies.

The group is led by Quentin Cappart and Louis-Martin Rousseau from [Polytechnique Montr√©al](https://www.polymtl.ca). It is associated with the interuniversity research centre on enterprise Networks, logistics and transportation ([CIRRELT](https://www.cirrelt.ca/)).
