# SeaPearl

**SeaPearl** (homonym of CPuRL, standing for *constraint programming using reinforcement learning*) is a flexible, easy-to-use, research-oriented, and open-source **constraint programming solver** able to natively use **deep reinforcement learning** algorithms for **learning value-selection heuristics**. The philosophy behind this solver is to ease and speed-up the development process to any researcher desiring to design learning-based approaches to improve constraint programming solvers.

The project is open-source and available on [Github](https://github.com/corail-research/SeaPearl.jl).
